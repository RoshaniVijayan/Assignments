# Weekly assignements for Python for AI 

Noted your messege. I understand that Python programming serve as essential building blocks for Financial/Statistical Modelling, and I’m sure it’ll bring a lot of value to many participants. 

However, as Python programming application is already part of my regular official activities, dedicating additional time to revisit fundamental Python concepts isn't as valuable for my specific situation. Hence, you can undersand intermittent presence of mine during these fundamental sessions based on my other official workload and responsibilities. This is in no way a reflection on the quality or importance of your sessions. 

I’m confident that these sessions are immensely beneficial to many others, and I hope you understand my position.
I wish you the very best for the grand success of this program.

Thank you for your understanding.

Best wishes,
