Hi ,

Greetings of the day!

I am writing to request an extension to work from home as per the advice and prescription of my surgeon, Dr. Shipra Kunwar, at Manipal Hospital, Kharadi, Pune, dated 30th August 2024. As mentioned in my earlier communication, I underwent major surgery on 17th August 2024 at Manipal Hospital, Kharadi, Pune. Due to post-surgery complications, I was hospitalised for nearly two weeks.

Based on my current recovery status and medical observation, I am unable to sit in a chair for more than two hours or use staircases. However, I am able to continue my work from a set-up where I can maintain a bed-rest position.

In light of this, I kindly request your approval to work from home for an additional four weeks as recommended by my surgeon, effective from dated 2nd September 2024 to 27th September 2024. This arrangement will enable me to continue fulfilling my official responsibilities while adhering to my post-surgery care plan.

Thank you for your understanding and your continued support during this time. 
I truly appreciate your consideration of my medical condition and the accommodations you have provided so far.

Best regards,
